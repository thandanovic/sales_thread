## 🚀 Quick Start (Current State)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bundle install
cd scraper && npm install && cd ..

# 2. Database is already created and migrated
rails db:schema:load  # if needed

# 3. Start the server
rails server

# 4. Test scraper
cd scraper
npm run investigate
npm run test-login
npm run scrape
```

## 🎯 What's Working

- ✅ Database schema complete
- ✅ Models with associations and validations
- ✅ Devise passwordless authentication (magic links)
- ✅ Pundit authorization with role-based access
- ✅ Scraper scripts ready to use (Playwright)
- ✅ ScraperService integration ready
- ✅ Full CRUD controllers for Shops, Products, Imports
- ✅ Complete views with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ CSV import with auto column detection
- ✅ CSV processing and product normalization
- ✅ Image download from URLs
- ✅ Flash messages and navigation
- ✅ Import progress tracking

## 🔜 Optional Enhancements

1. **Testing** - Write comprehensive RSpec tests
2. **Background Jobs** - Add Sidekiq for async processing
3. **Real-time Updates** - ActionCable for live progress
4. **Advanced Features** - Batch operations, webhooks, etc.
5. **Production Setup** - Deployment configuration

## 📝 Notes

### Devise Passwordless

Users will receive magic link emails. Configuration is in place, but you may need to configure email delivery for production.

### Scraper

The Playwright scraper is fully functional. To use:

```ruby
# In Rails console
ScraperService.test_login(username: 'user@example.com', password: 'password')
result = ScraperService.scrape_products(max_products: 10)
shop = Shop.create!(name: "Test Shop")
ScraperService.import_from_json(result[:file], shop)
```

### Next Development Session

Start by creating:
1. Home controller and root route
2. Shops controller for CRUD
3. Basic views with Tailwind

Then implement CSV import functionality.
